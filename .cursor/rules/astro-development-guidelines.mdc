## General

- Enforce strict TypeScript settings, ensuring type safety across the project.
- Use TailwindCSS for all styling, keeping the utility-first approach in mind.
- Ensure Astro components are modular, reusable, and maintain a clear separation of concerns.
- Order astro blocks like follows: component script, component template, html script tag, html style tag if required.
- All astro components files must be inside src/components/**.*.astro folder

## Performance Optimization

- Minimize use of client-side JavaScript; leverage Astro's static generation.
- Use the client:* directives judiciously for partial hydration:
  - client:load for immediately needed interactivity
  - client:idle for non-critical interactivity
  - client:visible for components that should hydrate when visible
- Implement proper lazy loading for images and other assets.

- Utilize Astro's built-in asset optimization features.
